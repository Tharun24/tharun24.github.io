I am a 4th year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University. I work with [Prof. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) in the [RUSHLAB](https://rushlab.blogs.rice.edu/). My primary research area is Extreme Scale Deep Learning using Randomized Hashing methods.

I previously interned as an **Applied Scientist** at **Amazon Search**, Palo Alto from May 2018 - Aug 2019. I worked on a myriad of problems like query-category prediction, super-fast reformulation for zero result queries, query to product prediction and fast approximate nearest neighbor search. My paper **Simultaneous Matching and Ranking as end-to-end Deep Classification: A Case study of Information Retrieval with 50M Documents** in conjunction with Amazon got published at **NeurIPS 2019**. 

I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering (2011-2015) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in).
