1. An AR based re-configurable framework for inspection that can be utilized in cross-domain applications such as maintenance and repair assistance in industrial inspection, health sector to record vitals, and automotive/avionics domain inspection. The inspection check-list can be prioritized by detecting the parts viewed in inspectorâ€™s field using deep learning principles.

2. The back-end of the framework is easily configurable for different applications where instructions and assistance manuals can be directly imported and visually integrated with inspection type.

3. We conduct a feasibility study on inspection modes such as Google Glass, Google Cardboard, Paper based and Tablet for inspection turnaround time, ease, and usefulness by taking a 3D printer inspection use-case.
