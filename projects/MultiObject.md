permalink: /projects/multipletarget

This was my BTech project which was completed with the guidance of [Dr. Sumohana Channappayya](https://www.iith.ac.in/~sumohana/). It aims to track multiple objects from aerial view.
The method involves data preprocessing followed by moving object detection and then Multiple Hypothesis Tracking by real time spawning, deleting and changing target tracks.
Go through the presentation below for details.
